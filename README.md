# 📈 Energy Usage Data Analysis 

This project analyzes energy usage data 💡 for the United States and New England from 2001-2022. It uses Python 🐍 for data visualization to understand trends and seasonal patterns.

## Data 📊

The data comes from a CSV file 📄 containing monthly energy usage for:

- United States - All Sectors 🏭
- United States - Electric Utility ⚡️  
- United States - Independent Power Producers 🔋
- United States - Commercial 🏢
- United States - Industrial 🏭
- New England - All Sectors 🌆

## Analysis 📈

The project performs:

- Data wrangling 🧹 using Pandas
- Timeseries manipulation with datetime 🕰
- Plotting trends and seasonality 📉 using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Resampling and rolling averages 📏

## Visualizations 📊

Various plots are generated to visualize:

- Daily 🌞, weekly 🗓, and monthly 🌜 seasonality
- Timeseries decomposition 📉
- Trend analysis using rolling averages 📈

## Running the Code 💻

To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repo 👯
2. Install requirements 📥 (`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`)
3. Run Jupyter notebook 📓
4. Modify and customize as needed ✏️
